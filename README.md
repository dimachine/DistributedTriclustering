Abstract
In our previous work an efficient one-pass online algorithm for triclustering of binary data (triadic formal contexts) was proposed. This algorithm is a modified version of the basic algorithm for OAC-triclustering approach; it has linear time and memory complexities. In this paper we parallelise it via map-reduce framework in order to make it suitable for big datasets. The results of computer experiments show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm; for example, it outperforms the online counterpart on Bibsonomy dataset with â‰ˆ 800, 000 triples.


It is based on the earlier work on a one-pass online algorithm for triclustering.
